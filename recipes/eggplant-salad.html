        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggplants</li>
            <li>1 small red or white onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1–2 cloves garlic, minced (optional, to taste)</li>
            <li>1–2 tablespoons lemon juice or vinegar (to taste)</li>
            <li>3 fresh parsley or dill, finely chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
            <li>salt, pepper etc</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Begin by roasting two large eggplants until their skins are blackened and the insides 
                    are soft. This can be done over an open flame, on a grill, or in a hot oven. Once roasted, 
                    allow the eggplants to cool slightly, then peel off the charred skin and let the flesh 
                    drain for 10–15 minutes to remove excess liquid.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Finely chop or mash the drained eggplant until smooth. In a bowl, combine it with one 
                    finely chopped onion, a minced garlic clove (optional), and gradually mix in olive oil. 
                    Add lemon juice or vinegar for a tangy flavor, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Refrigerate the salad for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors blend. Before serving, 
                    garnish with chopped fresh parsley or dill. Serve it chilled or at room temperature as a 
                    dip, spread, or side dish.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
