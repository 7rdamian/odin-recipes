            <li>1 celery</li>
            <li>3 potatoes</li>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You’ll start by sweating onions, carrots, and celery in olive oil with some tomato 
                    paste. Then, stir in more flavor with garlic, fennel seeds, salt, and pepper.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Pour in your broth (try homemade veggie or homemade chicken broth). Then, 
                    add canned tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage, and bay leaves (or add your favorite veggies).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You will allow the soup to simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 
                    minutes. Then toss in frozen peas and cook them for a few more minutes to heat through.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Before you serve, taste the soup and adjust with more salt and pepper. For a 
                    pop of flavor, add a dash of apple cider vinegar or fresh lemon juice.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
