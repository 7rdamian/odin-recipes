        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A classic dish in Eastern European and Balkan cuisine, Oriental Salad is a simple, 
            hearty, and refreshing potato-based salad. It’s made with boiled vegetables, 
            pickles, and often hard-boiled eggs, all tossed in sunflower oil and vinegar. 
            Light yet satisfying, it’s a popular choice during Lent, as a side dish, or even 
            a standalone meal, offering a perfect balance of tangy, savory, and earthy flavors.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2–3 medium potatoes</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots</li>
            <li>2 hard-boiled eggs (optional, skip for fasting/Lenten version)</li>
            <li>2–3 pickles (gherkins), finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 small onion or a few green onions, finely chopped (optional)</li>
            <li>1–2 tablespoons sunflower oil (or any neutral oil)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vinegar or lemon juice (to taste)</li>
            <li>salt, pepper etc</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Start by boiling the potatoes and carrots until they are fork-tender. Once cooked, 
                    let them cool slightly, then peel and dice them into small cubes. Meanwhile, 
                    hard-boil the eggs if you're using them. After they cool, peel and chop them as well. 
                    Slice the pickles into small, even pieces, and if using onions or olives, prepare those too.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In a large bowl, combine the chopped potatoes, carrots, eggs, pickles, and any optional 
                    ingredients. Season with salt and pepper, then drizzle the salad with sunflower oil and 
                    add vinegar or lemon juice to taste. Mix everything gently to keep the vegetable pieces 
                    intact while evenly coating them with the dressing.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Let the salad sit in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes before serving, so the flavors 
                    meld together. Serve chilled or at room temperature. Oriental Salad is versatile, easy to 
                    make, and perfect for both festive meals and everyday simplicity.
